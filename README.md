Recipes Project for The Odin Project

This project is a simple recipe webpage, showcasing basic HTML. Includes a homepage with links to individual recipes, each with a key ingredient: cheese. The recipe pages each show an image, food description, ingredients list, and cooking directions. They utilize embedded images, header and paragraph text, unordered lists, and ordered lists.
