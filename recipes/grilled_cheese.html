        <p>Grilled cheese is a warm, gooey American staple. Best served warm with tomato soup.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of bread or your choice</li>
            <li>1 slice of your favorite type of cheese</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp of butter</li>

            <li>Heat a grill pan or skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>While the pan is waring, butter one side of both slices of bread.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is warm, put one slice of bread, butter side down, on the pan.</li>
            <li>Layer your cheese on top of the bread. Place the remaining slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese.</li>
